Overwhelming emotion and anger management are also areas where I can be of help.

     <h1>How i work</h1>
     <p>
        I provide a non-judgemental approach.  I am a respectful, open and genuine person.  I am an integrative practitioner with a strong bias towards Cognitive Behaviour Therapy.  
        This means that together we will tackle any issues that you wish to work on by addressing what you are doing and how you think. 
         I will explain the approach I take and clarify any actions or techniques that I use if these are unfamiliar.

        My full-time private practice has morning, afternoon, and evening appointments available.   Sessions are by appointment only.
          Children under 18 years of age will require written consent from both parents.

     <h1>About</h1>
     <p>Hi is’m Janko Skudar.
        I feel extremely grateful to be one of those people who are doing what they love, so it seems to me like I don’t really have a job – I am constantly creating and supporting people. 
        I am convinced that in this phase of my life I am doing exactly what I am supposed to do.
        But, that wasn’t always the case. Although my career as psychotherapist has officially begun in 2020, only ten years earlier I graduated at the University of Zagreb and gained bachelor degree in petroleum engineering.
         After graduation I spent few years travelling around the world searching for myself. I tried to do many different jobs, but to no avail. 
         I couldn’t run away from my impulse to grow personally and professionally in direction of psychotherapy. 
        After few years spent in Canada, New Zealand, Germany and Croatia I settled down in Ireland where I embarked on a 4 year journey to become a psychotherapist. 
        Upon graduation I was employed by Pieta house where I was working mainly with clients who had difficulties with depression and trauma. I also worked part-time with addicts in Irish prison system.
